    "description": "Why visit? Besides its exotic scenery, Queenstown is known as the adventure capital of the world. “It gets your adrenaline racing,” says travel advisor Aanchal Gandhi. But Queenstown is also a relaxing destination if you prefer a slower pace — plus, the wine is great, says Gandhi. Who should go? Anyone looking for a diverse experience — from gastronomy to hiking in the mountains. Queenstown is family-friendly and if you're a “Lord of the Rings” fan, of course you'll want to visit Middle Earth. Don't miss: The Remarkables mountain range and the azure blue glaciers surrounding the city. You can enjoy the adrenaline rush with a bungee jump or blast across Lake Wakatipu and down the world-famous Kawarau and Shotover Rivers on the KJet.",

For a true bucket list experience, the Norwegian Arctic’s Svalbard remains one of the last undeveloped places on Earth, in part because of the difficulty in accessing it. “Wildlife encounters are a highlight of visiting this Arctic wonderland, with everything from walruses, Arctic foxes and seals to reindeer and polar bears,” explains Lebovitch. Who should go? Svalbard attracts wildlife lovers, adventurers and those who feel they have “seen it all.” Don’t miss: The Global Seed Vault, which safeguards seeds from all over the world to protect the future food supply.
